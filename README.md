1. Clone the repository.
```git clone https://github.com/AmineELo/Facebook-coding-challenge.git```

2. open the project with android studio

3. You can either ask me to add you as a Tester of the app or you can change the project ``app/res/values/String.xml``  file and replace ``facebook_app_id`` and ``fb_login_protocol_scheme`` by the ones you get from your facebook developper account.

4. Finally you can install the app to your phone and test it out
